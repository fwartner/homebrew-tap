# Homebrew Tap

A tap for all my tools that I release.

## Support me

I invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://wartner.io/open-source). You can support me by [buying one of my paid products](https://wartner.io/open-source/support-me).

I highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of my prpjects you are using. You'll find my address on [my contact page](https://wartner.me/contact). I publish all received postcards on [my virtual postcard wall](https://wartner.io/open-source/postcards).
